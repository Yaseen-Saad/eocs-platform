        title: "N-Body Problem Simulation",
        description: `The N-Body problem is a system of differential equations whose solutions are N curves that represent the motions of planets, stars or other celestial bodies.

Solving the N-Body problem requires getting the net force acting on each body for every interval of time, which can be done by numerically solving the following general equation:
$$m_i \\frac{d^2 x_i}{dt^2} = \\sum_{\\substack{j=1 \\\\ j \\ne i}}^{N} \\frac{G m_i m_j (x_j - x_i)}{\\|x_j - x_i\\|^3}$$
Given the initial conditions of the bodies, mainly the mass, position and velocity of each body, and using the result from this second-order ODE, one can get the acceleration of each body, and by numerically integrating for each timestep dt, one can simulate the motion of each body and how it changes due to the gravitational interactions between one and another.

To solve the N-Body problem numerically, we use integrators where: we give a timestep $dt$, and using the initial conditions we currently have, we approximate the result after time $t_n+dt$. Such integrators are called "Explicit Integrators", an example of one is the "Forward Euler":
$$y_{n+1}=y_n+dt\\cdot f(t_n,y_n)$$

In a simple ODE, $\\frac{dy}{dt}=f\\left(t,y\\right)$, with the initial $y\\left(t_0\\right)=y_0$ the goal is to find $y$ at later time intervals. Using the above equation, we can numerically approximate y at a later time.

As a shortcut to writing integrators by hand and solving ODEs, we can use the REBOUND library in Python and choose an integrator of our choice and then directly give our initial conditions and the library will output the results and simulate the process accordingly.

The Leap Frog integrator is a "Symplectic integrator", which gives bounded, oscillating errors that preserve the global structure of the simulation in the long-term.

To use the Leap Frog, we divide the calculation into KDK (kick the velocity to half its new velocity, drift the position fully, and then kick the velocity to its full new velocity):

Kick: We calculate the half-velocity of the body:
$$v_{half}\\left(t+\\frac{dt}{2}\\right)=v_0\\left(t\\right)+\\frac{a_{old}(t)}{2}dt$$

Drift: We calculate the new position of the body:
$$r\\left(t+dt\\right)=r\\left(t\\right)+vt+dt2dt$$

Then compute the acceleration:
$$a_{new}\\left(t+dt\\right)=\\frac{F\\left(t+dt\\right)}{m}$$

Kick: We calculate the full velocity:
$$v_{full}(t+dt)=v_{half}\\left(t+\\frac{dt}{2}\\right)+\\frac{a_{new}}{2}dt$$

Where $J$ is a coupling constant, normalized to 1 for simplicity, and $\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j$ are both adjacent spin values. The result is halved because this summation formula goes over all spin interactions twice.

To avoid falling into global minima, the Ising model is considered a canonical ensemble and $Z$ is defined as the partition function (number of forms of the Ising model, a really, really big number). Then, we can use the Boltzmann distribution to describe the probability for the system to be in any state $E$.

$$\\lim_{x \\to 0-} \\frac{d}{dx} |x| = -1$$

        description: `Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 276 BC-194 BC) was a Greek polymath, making major contributions in mathematics, geography, poetry, and astronomy. He was the chief librarian of the Library of Alexandria, the greatest centre of learning in the classical world. He is remembered foremost for making the first accurate estimate of the circumference of the Earth. He did this by examining the shadows cast by rods of known length in Alexandria and Syene; his estimate was within one or two percent of the true value.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm for enumerating all prime numbers up to a given value $N$. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. Associate to each number $n=2, \\dots, N$ a Boolean flag for primality, true or false. Set all flags to true.
2. Fetch the first unprocessed number $n$ whose flag is true. (On the first iteration, this will be $n=2$.) Terminate if $n^2 > N$.
3. Mark all multiples of $n$ as composite by setting their flag to false.
4. Go to step 2.

On termination, the primes are those numbers with flag true.

Eratosthenes has now requested your help. He wants to count the number of prime numbers up to $N$, but he is too busy measuring the distance from Syene to Alexandria.

**Note:** Your program should define a function \\texttt{primes(N)} that returns a list of primes up to $N$.

**Hint:** It is more convenient to make the prime flag a numpy array with \\texttt{prime = numpy.array([True for n in range(N+1)])}, rather than with a list. This means you can use convenient slicing and striding notation for the update of all composite numbers for a given $n$.`,

As an undergraduate in Bonn, he spent four years neglecting his studies of law in favour of fencing and drinking, and left without a degree. He became a teacher of mathematics in a secondary school; while on sick leave from teaching he wrote a paper on Abelian functions that won him an honourary doctorate from KÃ¶nigsberg, and he eventually was appointed a Professor at the University of Berlin.

In 1872 Weierstrass devised a function which is *everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable*. At the time many mathematicians believed that continuous functions might be non-differentiable only on limited sets, and his counterexample tore up several erroneous proofs that had implicitly made this assumption. Weierstrass' function is given by
$$ f(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a^k \\cos \\left( b^k \\pi x \\right)$$

where $a \\in (0, 1)$ and $b$ is a positive odd integer satisfying $ab > 1 + \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$. PoincarÃ© denounced Weierstrass' work as "an outrage against common sense"; Hermite described it as a "lamentable scourge".

He studied mathematics and physics at Cambridge under Whitehead, Hardy, and Thomson, and eventually won a faculty position at Cambridge in mathematical meteorology. He made many fundamental contributions to fluid mechanics, such as in Taylor-Couette flow, the Taylor-Green solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability; the latter arises in everything from clouds to nuclear explosions to supernovae.

In 1950 Taylor published a famous paper estimating the initial energy $E$ released by the Trinity nuclear test, which was highly classified at the time, using timed photographs of the expansion of the spherical ball of fire from four unclassified sources. Solving the equations describing the conservation of momentum, mass, and energy, and the equation of state, he calculated that the radius of the ball $R(t)$ should be related to $E$, the density of air $\\rho_{\\text{air}}$, and time $t$ through
$$ R(t) \\propto E^{1/5} \\rho_{\\text{air}}^{-1/5} t^{2/5} $$
and via experiment estimated that the constant of proportionality was about 1.

Taylor has now asked for your help.

        title: "Codon Adaptation Index (CAI)",
        description: `Dr. Mohamed Abdeltawab, a molecular biologist at the Institute for Synthetic Genomics, is designing a synthetic gene intended for high-level expression in *Escherichia coli*. Before ordering the DNA from a gene synthesis company, he wants to evaluate how well the gene's codon usage matches the optimal codon preferences of *E. coli*.

A common measure for this is the **Codon Adaptation Index (CAI)**, a value ranging from 0 to 1:
- CAI â 1.0: gene uses highly preferred codons (likely efficient expression).
- CAI â 0.0: gene uses rare codons (likely poor expression).

**Problem Data**

**Target gene coding sequence (CDS):**
\\texttt{ATGGCTGCCGCTGCGGCTTAA}

**Reference CDS sequences (highly expressed genes in *E. coli*):**
- \\texttt{ATGGCTGCTGCTGCTTAA}
- \\texttt{ATGGCCGCCGCCGCCGCTAA}
- \\texttt{ATGGAGGAGGAGGATAA}
- \\texttt{ATGCGTCGTCGTAGTAA}

**CAI Calculation Rules:**
1. Divide sequences into codons (triplets), ignoring the terminal stop codon.
2. Count codon frequencies in the reference set.
3. For each amino acid, identify the most frequently used codon.
4. Compute the relative adaptiveness $w_i$ of each codon:
   $$w_i = \\frac{\\text{frequency of codon } i}{\\max(\\text{frequency of codons for that amino acid})}$$
5. Calculate the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) for the target gene:
   $$CAI = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\right)^{1/n}$$
   where $n$ is the number of codons in the target gene (excluding stop codons).`,

        description: `At the Pacific Ocean Biodiversity Initiative, a team of marine bioinformaticians is processing thousands of DNA and protein sequences collected from deep-sea expeditions. These sequences, derived from environmental samples, include both:
- Nucleotide fragments from metagenomes.
- Protein sequences predicted from assembled genomes.

To avoid redundancy and improve downstream functional annotation, the team needs to cluster sequences based on their percentage identity. This will produce a non-redundant database that preserves all unique variants without retaining nearly identical duplicates.

**CD-HIT Suite:**
- **CD-HIT** â for clustering protein sequences.
- **CD-HIT-EST** â for clustering nucleotide sequences.

**Important Notes:**
1. The choice of executable depends on the type of sequence (protein vs. nucleotide).
2. CD-HIT uses a user-defined sequence identity threshold (\\texttt{-c}, e.g., 0.9 for 90% identity).
3. The allowable word size (\\texttt{-n}) is constrained by the identity threshold:
   - Higher thresholds allow larger word sizes (faster).
   - Lower thresholds require smaller word sizes (more sensitive).`,

**Definition of SNP**
A **single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)** is a position where the two sequences differ at the nucleotide level.
- Ambiguous bases (e.g., N, R, Y) may be excluded if filtering is enabled.
- Gaps ("-") may also be excluded if filtering is enabled.

**SNP Rate Formula**
The SNP rate is calculated as:
$$\\text{SNP Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Number of SNPs}}{\\text{Number of positions compared}}$$`,
